This is a fork of the env.js project (http://github.com/thatcher/env-js/). See that link for env.js details.

This fork is based on the Johnson Ruby gem (http://github.com/jbarnette/johnson)and will become obsolete when the Johnson support has been reintegrated into the master repo.

For now, you can install the envjs gem by installing Johnson:

  gem install johnson --prerelease

(You'll need to manually install any prerequisites it asks for) and then installing the envjs gem with

  gem install envjs
