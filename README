This is a fork of the env.js project (http://github.com/thatcher/env-js/). See that link for env.js details.

This fork is based on the Johnson Ruby gem (http://github.com/jbarnette/johnson) and will become obsolete when the Johnson support has been reintegrated into the master repo.

For now, you can install the envjs gem by installing Johnson:

  gem install johnson --prerelease

(You'll need to manually install any prerequisites it asks for) and then installing the envjs gem with

  gem install envjs

The envjs gem provides the envjsrb command, which functions as an extended version of the Johnson javascript shell. For example:

mbp:env-js smparkes$ envjsrb
js> this
=> [object Window 0]
js> window.location
=> about:blank
js> document.innerHTML
=> "<html><head><title></title></head><body></body></html>"
js> 

It's also possible to embed the envjs interpreter similar to the way it's done in Johnson, e.g.,

require 'rubygems' # if necessary
require 'johnson/tramonkey'
require 'envjs/runtime'

envjs = Johnson::Runtime.new
envjs.extend Envjs::Runtime
window = envjs.evaluate("")
puts window.location.to_s # == "about:blank"
puts window.document.innerHTML # == "<html><head><title></title></head><body></body></html>"
